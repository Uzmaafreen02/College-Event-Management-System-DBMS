# College-Event-Management-System-DBMS
I developed a web-based event management system using PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP, integrating secure authentication, event registration, and data validation. I optimized database performance with ER diagrams, SQL queries, stored procedures, and triggers. Through testing and debugging, I ensured a reliable, scalable, and efficient system.
